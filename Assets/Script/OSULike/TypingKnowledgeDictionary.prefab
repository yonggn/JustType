  - 'There are many ways to type with a keyborad: touch typing, hunt and peck,buffering
    and the combination of any of them!'
  - Touch typing is not the only way to type !

    !'
  - Did you know that the "Home Row" is not made up of home ?
  - Did you notice two bumps on your F and J keys?
  - You should put your index finger on F and J !
  - If you think your typing is too slow, try Touch Typing !
  - Your posture can affect your typing performance too !
  - If you just got a new keyboard, it's normal if you need more time to type faster
    with it !
  - 'Did you know that Chinese people have many keys on their keyoard ? (No, their
    keyboard is actually the same like us.) '
  - Did you know that QWERTY is not the only keyboard layout ?
  - Guess which game is this game developer's favourite game ? Resident Evil or Control?
  - 'Don''t panik ! Chill when you practice . '
  - Typing performance is measured by WPM (Word Per Minute) .
  - The average speed of typing is 38-40 WPM.
  - If you have typing speed of 60-70 WPM, you are considered as a fast typer !
  - It takes 2 hours and 40 minutes of practice to increase typing speed by 1 WPM.
